## Heart Attack Prediction Using SVM Algorithm (ML)

This is a classification problem with a range of input features as parameters and a binary target variable for predicting whether or not heart disease exists.

The project included a heart attack prediction study as well as thorough data processing of the dataset. Then, using SVM, a machine learning model was built and predictions were made. This is collab notebook code and the dataset used from Kaggle.

---------About the dataset-----------

Age : Age of the patient

Sex : Sex of the patient

exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

ca: number of major vessels (0-3)

cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type

Value 1: typical angina
Value 2: atypical angina
Value 3: non-anginal pain
Value 4: asymptomatic
trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results

Value 0: normal
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
thalach : maximum heart rate achieved

target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
