# Prediction of smoking status of a person using SVM(ML)

This is a classification problem with a range of input features as parameters and a binary target variable for predicting smoking behavior of a person.

The project included smoking habbit prediction as well as thorough data processing of the dataset. Using machine learning models were built and predictions were made. This is collab notebook code and the dataset used from Kaggle.
